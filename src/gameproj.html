                    This goal of this team project was to flesh out an idea, from initial 
                    brainstorming to designing the UI, for a game that would enhance the 
                    lives of students at MSOE. My group realized a common plight for MSOE 
                    students: a ton of coursework. To help relieve this burden, we decided 
                    on designing a productivity maximizer. This design process involved many 
                    important steps and deliverables. My team and I drew out numerous initial 
                    solutions, then once we decided on one, we drew several rough versions 
                    of what our UI could look like. We thought through our user flow and user 
                    journey, then after much deliberation, filtering and combining ideas, we 
                    reached a consensus on a design and then built our final wireframes in a 
                    program called Balsamiq. My role on the team involved a little bit of 
                    everything, both contributing ideas and producing some of the deliverables, 
                    also serving as the main leader. During our in-class meetings, I helped keep 
                    the group on track, was able to divide up the work into chunks that each 
                    individual could complete, and communicated often with the group to make 
                    sure everything went smoothly outside of class.

                This project was definitely a welcomed exercise in communication. I feel I excelled 
                in the explanation of my own solutions while also listening to my team members’ 
                great ideas, allowing us to efficiently focus in our ideas into one solid plan. 
                I was also able to use my close attention to detail to make sure our diagrams 
                and wireframes were readable and consistent. A big challenge initially was making 
                sure every team member had a clear idea of what they needed to do. We solved that 
                problem by putting a very clear to-do list in Microsoft Teams with names attached 
                to various objectives, allowing everyone to see precisely what they were responsible 
                for and to provide an easy way to communicate about those objectives.

                    This project taught me a lot about a design process I was completely unfamiliar 
                    with. I learned different strategies to brainstorm ideas and come to a decision, 
                    figured out effective ways to explain those ideas, and found new organizational 
                    techniques to streamline the realization of those ideas. This project also introduced 
                    me to wireframing, specifically in Balsamiq Wireframes. Wireframing is an easy 
                    way to bring a design out of your head and into format that can be shared, 
                    discussed, revised, and then implemented. Figuring out the nuances of Balsamiq 
                    was initially a challenge, but after some trial and error, I can say I’m not 
                    confident with the program. The design process explored through this project will 
                    be extremely helpful for my projects in the future. Not only will it help me 
                    come up with ideas and filter through them to find the best solution for a given 
                    problem, it’ll also help me document my processes in a way that can be presented to others.
