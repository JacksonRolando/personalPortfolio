                    The Wisconsin Decarceration Platform is a group based in Milwaukee 
                    formed to provide resources to those impacted by the criminal justice 
                    system. I worked very closely with people with less experience with 
                    technology to turn their ideas into features of the site. I was able 
                    to communicate my technical ideas in ways they could understand and 
                    contribute to. I took information I was presented with, moved it, and 
                    formatted it in a way that is easier to digest and sift through so 
                    that visitors to the site can find what they are looking for more 
                    quickly. I used Weebly's many available components in addition to some 
                    I made myself in order to overcome Weebly's shortcomings to present 
                    information effectively.

                    I was able to establish and maintain a common design language throughout 
                this project, scaling it as more information was added. A large part of 
                my role was the siteâ€™s organization, so I developed a sensical
                blueprint defining how information is presented on all parts of the site.
