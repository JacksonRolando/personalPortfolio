                    The Wisconsin Decarceration Platform is a group based in Milwaukee 
                    formed to provide resources to those impacted by the criminal justice 
                    system. I worked very closely with people with less experience with 
                    technology to turn their ideas into features of the site. This project 
                    shows that I have experience in talking to people not as well-versed 
                    in the tech space and am able to communicate my technical ideas in 
                    a way they can understand. My position was (and still is) the Webmaster 
                    of their Weebly website. I took information they had, moved it, and 
                    formatted it in a way that is easier to digest and sift through so 
                    that visitors to the site could find what they were looking for more 
                    quickly. I also added features that Weebly doesn’t natively support 
                    through custom HTML and JavaScript, like adding an events page that 
                    generates an attractive list of events from inputted data.

            <div class="px-10 pb-5 md:pb-0 text-justify md:max-w-5xl container mx-auto">
                I was able to establish and maintain a common design language throughout 
                this project, scaling it as more information was added. A large part of 
                this project was the site’s organization, and I feel I have made a great 
                blueprint for how information is presented on all parts of the site. A 
                large challenge I had with the site at first is that since Weebly doesn’t 
                easily support databases, the data is not actually stored anywhere except 
                for on the webpages themselves. While this is not an issue for many sections 
                of the site, for parts that needed to be generated with common style like 
                an events page, static text boxes were not going to cut it. I solved this 
                roadblock by storing the data in JSON format in a custom HTML block, then 
                in that same block used some JavaScript to manipulate the data and generate 
                HTML based on the events data, hiding events if they’ve passed. Through 
                working on the Wisconsin Decarceration Platform, I have improved my 
                communication skills, especially when speaking to people not well-versed in 
                the tech space. Being able to translate between tech speak and common 
                English will be an especially useful tool for me in the future.

                <div><img class=" rounded-lg border object-scale-down md:max-w-sm" src="./img/events.png"></div>

                    I also, through some trial and error, found a method of organization 
                    to take in many small requests, prioritize, then act on them in a 
                    timely manner, something that will also very much help my disorderly 
                    brain in my years to come. I also learned some very simple image editing 
                    techniques when cutting and coloring photos to use as icons on the 
                    homepage, something I didn’t know I would be able to figure out so easily. 
                    While I’ve used HTML before, I had never used JavaScript to generate an 
                    entire page of it, so figuring out that I could dynamically update an 
                    entire webpage as data changed was a very interesting technique that I 
                    will definitely be using on future projects. As for opportunities for 
                    improvements, I would love to look into making more complex uses of 
                    dynamic HTML updates without page refreshes.
