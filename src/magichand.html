                    For some time, I’ve been tinkering with DIY Wi-Fi-controlled lights, 
                    infatuated with the laziness they cause in the coolest way possible. 
                    I’ve flashed cheap Chinese switches with new firmware, set up a smart 
                    home hub on my Raspberry Pi, and coded my own animations on individually 
                    addressable LEDs. Using Alexa to control my many devices is very 
                    convenient, but I wanted something cooler, something that felt a little 
                    more futuristic. The Magic Hand allows me to control the lights in my 
                    room with waves of my hand, making me feel like I’m in a Science-Fiction 
                    movie. This project allowed me to experiment with AI outside of my studies, 
                    applying it to achieve a personal goal. I am extremely interested in data 
                    science, so it was only logical to make an entire project out of it. I 
                    coded the microcontroller, trained the recurrent neural network, and 
                    loaded it onto said microcontroller, and received some help from a friend, 
                    Miles Oquendo, in designing the battery management system to make the 
                    device cordless. A lot went into this project, and the final product shows it.

                I was able to compile a wide range of my skills for this project: my background 
                in coding with an object-oriented mindset to organize the many functions of 
                the device, my experience parsing data into a more useful form to take in 
                data for training, as well as my knowledge of machine learning to structure 
                data and use a neural network to yield an accurate classification of each 
                gesture. I was able to identify a problem that could utilize AI and applied 
                it to create a robust solution. When getting into the project, I wasn’t sure 
                where to start.

                    I had never used TensorFlow, nor had I loaded an AI model onto an Arduino 
                    via TensorFlow Lite. I hadn’t ever sent or received custom messages over 
                    Bluetooth. I had never had to think about power consumption on a battery-powered 
                    device. My work was cut out for me. Through this project, I was able to dive 
                    into these topics with the help of many google searches, official 
                    documentation, and YouTube tutorials. I now know how to use TensorFlow, an 
                    AI library I will be using for many years to come. I also gained valuable 
                    experience combining many complex concepts and methods into one program and 
                    product, a pattern used in all parts of the tech industry that I’ve had little 
                    prior experience in. Now that I have struggled through one AI-hardware project, 
                    I now know how not to initially set up my code. I’m sure I will create cool 
                    projects like this in the future, and the organization, readability, and 
                    documentation of those projects will be much better than this one. Now that I 
                    know what components need to be present for a project like this, I can better 
                    plan for them in my next project.
